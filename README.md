[00:03.92] The moon is high
[00:05.02] Like your friends were the night that we first met
[00:07.28] Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
[00:09.77] Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
[00:32.77] 
[00:13.14] The wine is cold
[00:14.36] Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
[00:16.65] Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
[00:19.04] Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe
[00:43.04] 
[00:23.00] (Ayy)
[00:23.46] Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (oh)
[00:25.71] Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (uh)
[00:28.07] Three times 'cause I've waited my whole life (one, two, one, two, three, four)
[01:07.07] 
[00:32.63] I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
[00:36.78] Uh-huh, that's right
[00:38.91] Darling, you're the one I want, and
[00:41.64] I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
[00:45.92] Uh-huh, that's right
[00:48.21] Darling, you're the one I want
[01:03.21] 
[00:50.56] In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
[00:57.76] Oh, you're the one I want
[01:10.26] 
[01:00.45] In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
[01:02.61] When you jumped in first, I went in too
[01:04.97] I'm with you, even if it makes me blue, which takes me back
[01:09.52] To the color that we painted your brother's wall
[01:11.99] Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
[01:14.53] We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so
[01:34.53] 
[01:18.53] (Ayy)
[01:18.87] Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (oh)
[01:21.19] Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (uh)
[01:23.60] Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (one, two, one, two, three, four), aah
[02:05.60] 
[01:28.01] I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
[01:32.12] Uh-huh, that's right
[01:34.32] Darling, you're the one I want, and
[01:37.20] I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
[01:41.49] Uh-huh, that's right
[01:43.66] Darling, you're the one I want
[01:58.66] 
[01:46.26] In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
[01:52.94] Oh, you're the one I want
[02:05.44] 
[01:55.91] I want to drive away with you
[01:58.37] I want your complications too
[02:00.41] I want your dreary Mondays
[02:02.32] Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
[02:19.32] 
[02:05.04] I want to drive away with you
[02:07.34] I want your complications too
[02:09.61] I want your dreary Mondays
[02:11.65] Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
[02:28.65] 
[02:18.49] Uh-huh
[02:21.49] 
[02:23.23] I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
[02:27.66] Ah-ah, that's right
[02:30.96] You're the one I want
[02:32.40] I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
[02:36.82] Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
[02:55.32] 
[02:41.86] I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
[02:46.17] Uh-huh, that's right
[02:48.25] Darling, you're the one I want, and
[02:50.96] I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
[02:55.10] Uh-huh, that's right
[02:57.57] Darling, you're the one I want
[03:12.57] 
[03:00.03] In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
[03:07.70] You're the one I want
[03:09.07] In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
[03:16.05] Oh, you're the one I want
[03:28.55] 
[03:20.02] You're the one I want, one I want
[03:22.30] You're the one I want...
